## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
data = read.csv("TS3_Raw_tree_data.csv")
data
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(tidycensus)
library(sf)
```
```{r}

data <- data %>%
  mutate(City_Name = str_extract(City, "^[^,]+")) |>
  mutate(State = str_extract(City,"[A-Z]{2}$"))
data
```
```{r}
Records_by_state <- data |>
  count(State, name = "Records")
```

```{r}
filtered_data <- data |>
  filter(State == "NC" | State == "SC")
```
